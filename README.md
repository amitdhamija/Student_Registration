<b>Description:</b><br>
A console application used to register students for a course.

The student registration system will display the list of courses available 
for registration.  The program should show current registration numbers 
and available seats for each course.  After a student successfully 
registers, the registration information should be stored in a file.

<b>The system should provide several features:</b>

 - The ability for students to view an alphabetical list of courses
   that includes the course identification number, course dates, name,
   brief summary, the enrollment limit, and the number of students
   already enrolled.
 - The ability for students to register or un-register for a course.
 - The ability for a student to see a list of classes for which he/she
   is currently registered.

<b>There are several business rules:</b>

 - The system should not allow a student to register for a full course.
 - The system should not allow one student to view the registration
   information for another student.
 - The system should not allow a student to un-register from a course
   for which he/she is not registered.
